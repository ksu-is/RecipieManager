Yet another tool to manage receipes, shopping lists and your daily menu

For quite some time, I looked around for a tool, that allows me to store my favorite receipes, easily generate shopping lists out of them and put up a daily menu. But no tool around satisfied all my needs. So I started my very own foodmanager.
There is no fixed roadmap, no release cycle and absolutely no idea, where this will end up. But if you are interested in the topic, feel free to help, either by cloning and working on your own set of ideas, or by contacting me to help further developing this branch.

## Getting started
To get involved with development, clone the repository to your local IDE and perform the following tasks:
- Create a database with the correct structure by running `manage.py migrate`
- Add a super-admin user to the database to start playing around by running `manage.py createsuperuser`

## Contact
The foodmanager project was started and is currently run by Christoph Krammer <chris@twotigers.de>.
